# CI/CD pipeline with Concourse
A troubleshooting swiss-army knife application

## Thanks
Thanks to Alex Suraci for inventing Concourse CI, and to Pivotal and VMware for sponsoring him and a team of developers to work since 2014.

This pipeline was created as part of learning Concourse using the Stark & Wayne tutorial at https://concoursetutorial.com
